The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as the domestic cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. It is the only 
domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat
 occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat
 avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Its retractable claws are
 adapted to killing small prey species such as mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a
 crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizationsâ€”including meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and
  gruntingâ€”as well as body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made
  by small mammals. It secretes and perceives pheromones.

  The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to be the Late Latin word cattus, which was first used at
  the beginning of the 6th century.[4] The Late Latin word may be derived from an unidentified African language.[5] The
  Nubian word kaddÃ®ska 'wildcat' and Nobiin kadÄ«s are possible sources or cognates
